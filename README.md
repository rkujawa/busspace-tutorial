=======================

Materials for bus_space(9) tutorial for EuroBSDcon 2012.

Prerequisites for running the materials:
- gcc, g++ and usual build tools
- X11 client libraries (server not required but recommended)
- git

Download and run the scripts/setup.sh script. It will automagically fetch the 
git repositories, build the GXemul, the NetBSD tools and kernel. This script 
was tested only on the NetBSD 6 and MacOS X 10.8.2, YMMV.
